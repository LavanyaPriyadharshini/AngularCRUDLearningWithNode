working of NGRX , what happens with using NGRX and what happens without using it


Imagine a Family House (Your Angular App)

Without NgRx (Normal Angular)

Each family member (component) writes down their own grocery list (tasks) on their personal notepad.
You say: "Add milk to the list."
You add it on your notepad ✅ … but your sister’s notepad doesn’t know you added milk ❌.
Now, when mom goes shopping, she looks at her notepad → no milk.
Result: confusion, duplicates, missing items.
You constantly have to tell each person "Hey, update your list too!"


With NgRx (State Management)

Instead of everyone having their own notepad, there is ONE big whiteboard in the kitchen (Store).
Every family member reads and writes only on this central whiteboard.
You say: "Add milk."
You don’t write it yourself. You shout the instruction: "Add milk!" (this is the Action).
The family rulebook (Reducer) says:
“If someone shouts Add milk, take the whiteboard, make a new copy, and add ‘milk’ to it.”
The whiteboard is updated (Store).
Now everyone in the family sees milk instantly because they all look at the same whiteboard (Selector → Component UI).
No one keeps private notes. No confusion, no duplicates.


What Happens in Your Task Example

You clicked “Add New Task”.
That shout is an Action: “Hey Reducer, add this task.”
Reducer follows the rules → creates a new state (with your new task).
The Store (whiteboard) now has this updated list.
Your component (family member) is already watching the store, so it sees the update automatically.
UI refreshes → new task shows up.


Without NgRx in Your Task Example

You’d just have tasks: [] inside one component.
When you add a task, you push it into that array.
Problem? If another component also needs tasks (like a dashboard showing “Number of tasks”), it won’t know unless you write extra code to share that array.
As your app grows, you’ll be running around trying to sync tasks between many places → just like chasing family members to update their notes. 😅


So, in short:

Without NgRx = each person keeps their own copy, leading to chaos.
With NgRx = one central whiteboard, rules for updating, and everyone always sees the latest truth.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

below is the very detailed explanation with respect to the state management application

The Setup

Whiteboard = Store (AppState)
Family rules = Reducer , task.reducer.ts
Shouts = Actions , task.actions.ts
Family members = Components , statemangement component.ts
Everyone reading the whiteboard = Selectors , task.selector.ts

--------------------

Add Task

👉 You click “Add New Task”.
You (component) don’t add it yourself. Instead, you shout:
“AddTask: {title: 'Buy milk', description: '2 liters'}”
Reducer hears this shout.
Rulebook says: “If action is AddTask, copy the current whiteboard list, add the new task, return the new list.”
Whiteboard is updated.
Everyone (all components) sees milk appear instantly.


Add task Without NgRx: - practical difficulty ,we must use @input and @output to pass the values to other components or behaviour subject

You push {title: 'Buy milk'} into your local array.
Other components won’t know unless you write code to pass that array around.
You’re basically running to each family member: “Hey, I added milk, please write it down too.”


---------------------------------------------

Update Task

👉 You edit a task: change “Buy milk” → “Buy almond milk”.
You shout:
“UpdateTask: {id: 1, title: 'Buy almond milk'}”
Reducer rule: “Find the task with id 1, update it, and return a new copy of the list.”
Whiteboard updates.
Everyone sees “Buy almond milk”..

✅ Without NgRx:
You’d manually update the object in your component.
Other components may still show “Buy milk” unless you manually notify them.
That’s like you fixing your notepad, but your sister still has the old version.

---------------------------------------------------

Delete Task

👉 You delete a task: Remove “Buy almond milk”.
You shout:
“DeleteTask: {id: 1}”
Reducer rule: “Filter out task with id 1 from the whiteboard list.”
Whiteboard updates.
Everyone sees that the task disappeared.

✅ Without NgRx:

You’d remove it from your local array.
But unless you notify everyone else, other parts of the app may still think the task exists.
That’s like you erasing from your notebook, but your brother still thinks he has to buy milk.
