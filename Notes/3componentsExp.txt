here we explain ,how the ngrx in 3 components work ,(statemanagement,tasklists and taskcounters)
before going through this, see to the practical example notes first

Store – the single source of truth (like a global database in memory).

Actions – messages you send (“AddTask”, “UpdateTask”).

Reducers – pure functions that change the state based on actions.
Reducers must be pure (no HTTP calls inside them).

Selectors – queries to pick data from the store.




1. StateManagementComponent

Acts like the control center.
It can dispatch actions (addTask, updateTask, deleteTask) → meaning it tells NgRx to change the state.
Example: Click "Add New Task" → dispatches addTask({ task }).

2.TaskListComponent

Purely reads the state (tasks$ | async) using the selector.
Shows the list of tasks and buttons to update/delete.
Doesn’t store its own copy of tasks → it always watches the single NgRx store.

3.TaskCounterComponent

Also reads the same state, but only cares about the number of tasks.
It uses a selector like:
This means TaskCounter only gets the count, not the full tasks array.
Example: If TaskList adds a task → TaskCounter automatically updates its count.



What NgRx Is Doing Behind the Scenes

Think of NgRx like a single shared whiteboard in an office:
🖊️ StateManagementComponent writes new tasks on the whiteboard.
👀 TaskListComponent looks at the whiteboard and shows all the tasks.
🔢 TaskCounterComponent just counts how many notes are on the whiteboard.

Now here’s the magic:

Nobody keeps their own private copy of the tasks.
They all trust the single whiteboard (NgRx Store).
When something changes (like adding, updating, or deleting a task), NgRx notifies all watchers (components) instantly.



What If We Did NOT Use NgRx?

Without NgRx, you’d probably:
Store tasks inside StateManagementComponent (in a local array).
To show them in TaskListComponent, you’d pass tasks via @Input().
To update/delete, you’d emit events via @Output() back up.
To show the count in TaskCounterComponent, you’d pass tasks down again or create a service with BehaviorSubject.

⚠️ The more components you add, the more spaghetti you get (inputs, outputs, event emitters, services everywhere).


Example flow in your app right now:

You click Add New Task in StateManagementComponent.
NgRx dispatch → reducer → adds task to Store.
Store updates → TaskListComponent sees new task → updates UI.
Store updates → TaskCounterComponent sees length changed → updates count.
No manual data passing, no event bubbling.
