NgRx follows the Redux pattern. Here’s the flow: - it is a state management technique

State – The single store (like a big JSON object).
Actions – Plain objects describing “what happened”.
Reducers – Pure functions that update state based on actions.
Selectors – Functions to fetch slices of state.
Effects – Handle side effects (API calls, async tasks).
Store – Centralized state container. -- this is the place where the state is managed
